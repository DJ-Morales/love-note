            My love, you are my sun, my moon and stars. My entire universe. I
            feel so much more complete when I am with you. When I met you, I
            knew my life would never be the same. You directly inject happiness
            into my everyday life, everyday with you is like heaven on earth.

            When I tell you love you, it isn't just out of habit. I say it
            because you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are
            my everything. My one and only. The only one in my heart. My heart
            skips when I think of you. There isn't a day where I don't have you
            on my mind.
